bornagain's documentation
=====================================

The bornagain python module is meant to be used for the analysis and simulation of 
x-ray diffraction under the Born approximation.  It is not the first attempt to create
such a module, hence the name "bornagain".

Nothing is finished in bornagain so far.  But there is a decent class for handling diffraction patterns with multi-panel detectors.  And there is a fast gpu simulation core that is coming along.  We will eventually add a few file readers and viewers.

bornagain's documentation
=====================================

The bornagain python package is meant to be used for the simulation and analysis of
x-ray diffraction under the Born approximation.  It is not the first attempt to create
such a package, hence the double-meaning of the name.  Bornagain is under continuous development at this time.  Don't be surprised if the API changes somewhat.

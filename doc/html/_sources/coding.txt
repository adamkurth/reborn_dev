Coding guidlines for developers
===============================

* The bornagain API is meant to be an "interface" for analysis and simulation.  That is, we envision that the user will be working from an iPython prompt or similar.  We will be walking a fine line between keeping the high-level classes clean yet powerful. 
* Don't worry about speed until it is necessary.  Usability is first.
* Always write tests along with modules.  We will use `pytest <http://doc.pytest.org/>`_ for testing.
* All units are SI (angles in radians) unless there is a very good reason to do something different.
* Follow the PEP8 guidelines to the greatest extent possible.  The `pep8 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8/>`_ program can be used to check for this.
* Use four spaces, not tabs.
* Just because you *can* do something clever, doesn't mean you should.  Keep the code clean.
* Docstrings follow the `Google format <https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

pyqtgraph
=========

The |pyqtgraph| package is great for interacting with data.  It has many nice features that are not found in
|matplotlib|.  However, it is not nearly as well documented as |matplotlib|.  Here are some common things we do with
|pyqtgraph|.

The examples have been moved to the example gallery: look here :ref:`plot_pyqtgraph`.

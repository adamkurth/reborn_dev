Diffration simulations
======================

The most basic starting point for a diffraction pattern from a collection of atoms is:

   :math:`I(\vec{q}) = I_0 r_e^2 |F(\vec{q})|^2 \Delta\Omega`

where the overall structure factor is

   :math:`F(\vec{q}) = \sum_n f_n(q)e^{i\vec{q}\cdot\vec{r}_n}`

and :math:`f_n(q)` is the wavelength-dependent scattering factor for atom :math:`n`.

More will follow from here.
